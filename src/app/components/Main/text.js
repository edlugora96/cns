ctext: `# What We Do
We offer tailor made courses in English, French, and Portuguese for focused 1-2-1 individual or group classes.


Our classes are designed with advanced technological tools (ebeam & mindmapping). Our classes prepare students for real-life challenges in their careers through media and/or news sources and real situation simulations.


We select specific subjects and techniques, along with the most suitable professional to meet the expectations and necessities of each student and their learning style. All our students are interviewed by an educational coordinator at the beginning of each course to better understand their objectives and profile. All in-class content is sent to the student by email within 24 hours after the class.


All class material is verified by CNS INTERNATIONAL.
